# Charts
This project is just a clone of the project, Charts by danielgindi: [danielgindi/Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts/blob/master/)

there is an update on his lib. but he has changed plenty of the functionality, what I did in this implementation is keep all the old functionality and adapt it for swift 3.0 so it can be used with Xcode 8.x and swift 3.0, since that is one of the issues now, without having to modify any of your code, this is a first build


* Xcode 8.0 / Swift 3.0
